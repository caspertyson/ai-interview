# InterviewAI.site

## Overview
InterviewAI.site is an innovative platform designed to help individuals prepare for job interviews 
through the power of artificial intelligence. Originating from a startup idea, the site leverages GPT 
API to simulate interview scenarios, allowing users to practice and improve their interview skills. 
Recognizing the improvement in performance after initial interview experiences, InterviewAI.site aims 
to offer users the opportunity to gain preliminary practice and enhance their confidence without the 
risk of missing out on real opportunities.

Initially built with AWS Lambda and EC2 for backend processing, InterviewAI.site has since migrated to 
Google Functions (as this is where all of my projects are now). The front-end is developed using 
React, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface, while hosting is managed through Firebase, 
ensuring a secure and reliable access to the platform.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive front-end.
- **Google Functions**: Handles backend logic.
- **Firebase**: Used for hosting the website and managing backend services.
- **GPT API**: Powers the AI-driven interview simulations, offering realistic and varied practice 
scenarios.

## Features
- **AI-driven Interview Practice**: Engage in simulated interviews to prepare for real-life scenarios.
- **Accessible Anywhere, Instantly**: Practice interviews at your convenience, with no risk of 
jeopardizing actual job opportunities.
